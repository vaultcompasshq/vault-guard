 * scaffolded `@v1.7.0` -- the action that installs its scanner from inside the

 * repository that ran `vault-guard init` after the release.
 *
 * Read the tag as "which version of the workflow step", not as "which version
 * of the scanner". Bump it whenever a release moves the Action tag, package

  // vendor-shaped value in a test blocks whether or not it is live, because the
  // scanner cannot distinguish a real `sk-ant-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA` string from a
  // convincing fabricated one. Fabricate test tokens as fragments joined at
  // runtime, or use the documented placeholder words. `init` prints a one-line

Vault Guard is the local secret scanner for this repository. Follow these rules
before writing, editing, or committing code.

## Before applying edits

1. Call the Vault Guard MCP tool \`scan_text\` on any proposed file content that
   may contain credentials (API keys, tokens, connection strings, private keys).
2. If findings are returned, do **not** write the secret material. Redact or
   replace with environment variables / placeholders and scan again.
3. For whole files on disk, use \`scan_file\`. For directories, use
   \`scan_workspace\`.

## Before committing

- Ensure \`vault-guard scan --staged\` passes (pre-commit hook enforces this).
- Never use \`git commit --no-verify\` to bypass secret checks unless the user
  explicitly requests an emergency bypass.

## Merge MCP config (manual)

Copy the \`mcpServers\` block from \`.vault-guard/mcp-snippet.json\` into your
editor MCP config (e.g. \`~/.cursor/mcp.json\` or Claude Desktop config). Vault
Guard does not modify files outside this repository.

## History scanning

Vault Guard does not scan Git history. Use Gitleaks or TruffleHog for retroactive
history mining alongside Vault Guard's working-tree protection.
