// Executes action.yml's own install and run steps, under the exact bash
// invocation GitHub Actions uses for a composite `shell: bash` step:
//
//   bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The action used to run
// `npx --yes "@vaultcompass/vault-guard@${VG_VERSION}"` from inside the
// checkout, which put the choice of PROGRAM inside the tree under judgment by
// two routes: a committed `.npmrc` repoints the registry npx fetches from, and
// a copy already in the head's `node_modules` wins outright, with the version
// pin degraded to a satisfaction check on a package the head wrote. The scanner
// is a control input, and a gate that reads its config from the base branch and
// then runs a binary the head chose has moved the decision rather than removed
// it.
//
// Every fact this file asserts is read out of action.yml: the script, the step's
// `env:` mapping, and the step's `working-directory:`. A harness with its own
// table of variables, or its own idea of a step's cwd, asserts a property of
// itself -- the two lines that carry the whole boundary are "which directory is
// npm started in" and "which prefix does it install under", and a harness that
// supplies those cannot see them go missing.
//
// npm IS STUBBED HERE, which bounds what this file can prove: that the action no
// longer ASKS npm to run from inside the checkout. What real npm does when it is
// asked to is a decision of the real client, and bench/action-install.cjs is
// what pins that, with two local registries and a real install.
