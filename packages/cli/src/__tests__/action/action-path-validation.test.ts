// Runs action.yml's REAL "Validate inputs" step, and reads the file for the
// shapes a behavioural test cannot see.
//
// Two kinds of assertion live here, and the second is what keeps the first
// honest:
//
//   1. Behavioural: the step accepts and rejects the right values, exercised by
//      running it under the real bash with the step's own `env:` mapping.
//   2. Textual: action.yml actually contains the idioms that behaviour was
//      written against -- the install step, the absolute binary, the
//      working-directory on both steps -- and does not contain the shapes known
//      to break them. Without these, a step could be deleted outright and the
//      behavioural half would keep passing against whatever was left.
//
// The original regression this file inherits: a bash `=~` pattern written
// `{1,256}` fails to COMPILE on macOS, where the BSD regex engine sets
// RE_DUP_MAX to 255. A pattern that fails to compile does not match, so every
// path input -- including the default `.` -- was rejected, and the action was
// unusable on macOS while passing perfectly on the ubuntu runners CI used.
// scripts/test-action-path-validation.sh runs the same guards on a macOS runner,
// where that asymmetry is visible.
