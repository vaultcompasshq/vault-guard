/**
 * Read a staged blob from the index, not the worktree.

 * relative to a subdirectory is what produced "fatal: path
 * 'pkg/deep/staged.ts' is in the index, but not 'staged.ts'" and, one silent
 * downgrade later, a clean bill of health over a real staged credential.
 *
 * The blob is resolved in two steps -- `git ls-files -s -- <path>` for the
 * object id, then `git cat-file blob <id>` for the content -- rather than the
 * single `git show :<path>` this used to run. `git show`'s `:<path>` revision
 * syntax also accepts the `:<stage>:<path>` form, so a staged file whose
 * repo-relative path begins `0:`, `1:`, `2:` or `3:` is parsed as a STAGE
 * reference to a different, shorter path. Staged beside a clean file of that
 * shorter name, the crafted file's own content is never read: `git show`
 * returns the clean neighbour while the finding is recorded against the
 * crafted name, so a real staged secret sails through under a clean result.
 *
 * `git ls-files -- <path>` never routes the path through git's revision
 * parser -- it is a pathspec after `--`, and the exact-path match in
 * {@link parseStagedBlobId} discards anything the pathspec over-matched -- and
 * `git cat-file blob <id>` then reads the immutable object id, so no
 * attacker-controlled path text can steer which blob is read. This is chosen
 * over merely prefixing the path with `./` (which also defeats the stage-ref
 * parse) because it keeps the path out of the revision grammar entirely rather
 * than relying on one more corner of that grammar behaving as expected.
